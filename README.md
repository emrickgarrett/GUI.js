# GUI.js
Just a small Javascript Library I'm writing for a class project

This Library is meant to be used with GUI.java. GUI.js allows the pages to simply call a function similar to how JQuery works to create an animated and nice looking Navigation bar for use on their site.

This was simply a cool project idea I came up for in an introductory course and was not taken that far into development. Overall, it's a neat little project.
